title: "Program"

The workshop will take place at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Cologne (see
[Venue](venue.qmd) for directions).
All scheduled talks and organized sessions will be held in the
main room **Cohn-Vossen** (room 313). Adjacent to it, **Seminarraum 3** (room 314) will serve as the catering area for
lunch and coffee breaks and as an informal workspace for discussions and small-group collaboration,
particularly during free or hacking sessions.

There are four types of contributions: plenary talks, contributed talks, one idea talks, and
hands-on sessions:

* <span class="slotcat plenary">**Plenary talks**</span> have a complete 90-minute slot (approx. 75 minutes contribution + 15 minutes
  discussion) and can be a regular scientific presentation, a package introduction, a hands-on
  session, or a mixture thereof. Presenters are encouraged to add their slides to the
  [trudi-2026-materials](https://github.com/trixi-framework/trudi-2026-materials) repository.
* <span class="slotcat contributed">**Contributed talks**</span> have a 30-minute slot for a regular scientific presentation (approx. 25
  minutes contribution + 5 minutes discussion) and are often thematically related to the afternoon
  hands-on sessions. Presenters are encouraged to add their slides to the
  [trudi-2026-materials](https://github.com/trixi-framework/trudi-2026-materials) repository.
* <span class="slotcat oneidea">**One idea talks**</span> have a 20-minute slot (approx. 15 minutes contribution + 5 minutes discussion)
  to present one specific concept (scheme, algorithm, code part etc.) or "one idea". Presenters are
  encouraged to add their slides to the
  [trudi-2026-materials](https://github.com/trixi-framework/trudi-2026-materials) repository.
* <span class="slotcat handson">**Hands-on sessions**</span> have a complete 90-minute slot and its structure is completely up to the
  presenters. We suggest to include, e.g., features and capabilities, algorithmic and HPC aspects,
  current state and future developments, and an introduction into how to set up and run a simulation
  with your package. Any additional material for the TRUDI audience should be added to the
  [trudi-2026-materials](https://github.com/trixi-framework/trudi-2026-materials) repository.

In addition, each afternoon there is an <span class="slotcat open">**open session**</span> to interact and collaborate with other
TRUDIs. These slots can be freely used for, e.g., small meetings, coding sessions, or spontaneous
science heurekas.
