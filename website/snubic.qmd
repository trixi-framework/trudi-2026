SNuBIC (short title for <em>Structure-preserving Numerical Methods for Bulk and Interface-Coupling
of Heterogeneous Models</em>) is a <a href="https://snubic.io/team" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">team of researchers</a> funded
by the  <a href="http://www.dfg.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">German
Research Foundation</a> under the grant number DFG-FOR5409 to investigate the modeling and
simulation of coupled systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). While the
development of accurate numerical methods for various types of PDEs is still a very active research
field, most complex applications are described by coupled systems of several PDEs, i.e. by
heterogeneous models, like magnetised plasmas, complex fluids and electro-chemical processes. Key
aspects of our  research unit are <a href="https://snubic.io/about/coupling" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">bulk- and
interface-coupling</a>,
<a href="https://snubic.io/about/structure-preservation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">structure-preserving numerical methods</a>,
and <a href="https://snubic.io/about/code-development" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">re-usable code development</a>.
