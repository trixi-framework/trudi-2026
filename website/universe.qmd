The key profile area <a href="https://kpa-universe.uni-koeln.de" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Dynamics of the Universe</a> of the
University of Cologne coordinates research between different disciplines of astrophysics
(observations, instrument development, theory & simulation, laboratory astrophysics),
applied mathematics and computer science, digital humanities, and geophysics. One
particular aim is to establish a new research area *Astroinformatics* at the University.
A main part of the key profile area is the new cluster of excellence
<a href="https://dynaverse.astro.uni-koeln.de/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">DynaVerse</a>
together with University Bonn, the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, the German Aerospace
Center, and the Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies. DynaVerse launched in January 2026.
