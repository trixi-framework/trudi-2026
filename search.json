While the development of accurate numerical methods for various types of PDEs is still a very active research field, most complex applications are described by coupled systems of several PDEs, i.e. by heterogeneous models, like magnetised plasmas, complex fluids and electro-chemical processes. Key aspects of our research unit are bulk- and interface-coupling, structure-preserving numerical methods, and re-usable code development."
