    "text": "SNuBIC (short title for Structure-preserving Numerical Methods for Bulk and Interface-Coupling of Heterogeneous Models) is a team of researchers funded by the German Research Foundation under the grant number DFG-FOR5409 to investigate the modeling and simulation of coupled systems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). While the development of accurate numerical methods for various types of PDEs is still a very active research field, most complex applications are described by coupled systems of several PDEs, i.e. by heterogeneous models, like magnetised plasmas, complex fluids and electro-chemical processes. Key aspects of our research unit are bulk- and interface-coupling, structure-preserving numerical methods, and re-usable code development."
